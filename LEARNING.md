```
This file is a simple descriptor for the learning sub-directories of my languages folders
Each language folder has a learning project, which covers fundamentals to that language: e.g.
  code
   |- c 
      \- learning
      \- ...
   |- haskell
      \- learning
      \- ...
This file to provide some insight and semantics to the folder, since most local projects are
not as centralized/organized as a git project
```
